The initial aromas are intense and lifted with perfumes of white peach, nectarine/stone fruit backed by the wonderful pungency of citrus flowers. Although fermented in oak there is only an underpinning whisper of it present in the bouquet. The palate is up front with fruit showing a predominance of pears and citrus. It has weight, but with true elegance and softness. It finishes with a sense of depth and an aftertaste of nuttiness, tempered with fruit.\",\n",

Peach, Asian pear, honeysuckle and plum on the nose are accented by subtle notes of hazelnut, brioche and tarragon.

With a lovely hint of viscosity to the mouthfeel, the flavors seem to glide across the palate, offering a medley of orchard fruit, Meyer lemon, and green pineapple notes, as well as hints of white tea and wet Riverstone minerality that carry through to a lingering finish.\",\n",

It is sourced from a single rolling vineyard in the Russian River Valley, part of the famed Dutton Ranch.

The wine is strikingly aromatic with ripened mandarin, blood orange and spiced apple fruits, shot through with honeysuckle and hazelnut spice.
